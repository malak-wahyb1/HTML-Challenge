                <p class="fifat">what's FIFA</p>
                <p class="fifas">is the international governing body of association football, beach football and futsal. It was founded in 1904[3] to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must each also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania) and CONMEBOL (South America).</p>

            <h2>world cup 2022</h2>
            <p>This tournament is scheduled to be the last with 32 participating teams, as the field will increase to 48 teams for the 2026 edition. Due to Qatar's intense climatic conditions,[B] this World Cup is being held during November and December.[C][2][3] It is being played in a reduced timeframe of 29 days. 64 matches are being played in eight venues across five cities. The opening match was between Qatar and Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium, Al Khor. In their first-ever World Cup appearance, Qatar lost their opening game – the first host nation to do so.[4] After losing their first two games, Qatar were eliminated, the earliest a host team had been eliminated from the tournament,[5][6] and the second host nation not to progress past the first stage.[D] The final will be held on 18 December 2022 at Lusail Stadium, coinciding with Qatar's National Day.[7]

            <h2>Facts About Qatar</h2>
            <p>
                Qatar is the smallest nation ever to host the World Cup in terms of population and land area. Qatar has a population of only 2.6 million, which makes it the smallest nation to host an event of this magnitude.

This will be the second time an Asian country has hosted the event, following South Korea & Japan in 2002. Qatar will be the first Arab country to host the FIFA World Cup. In any case, Qatar will be the first Arab or Muslim nation to host the full event.</p>
